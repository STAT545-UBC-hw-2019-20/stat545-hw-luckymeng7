## About me

Hello, I'm Xuemeng Li, a master of engineering in ECE **student** in UBC as well as a system validation **engineer** for a hardware company. I'm passionate about robotics and data analysis. I'm open to any related opportunities. 

Living in Vancouver is quite a pleasure. Besides work, I enjoy to hikig in the summer :evergreen_tree: and snowbording :snowboarder: in winter. Also, I love travel. Each year I have at least one long trip :airplane: and several small trips :red_car: to get relax from busy life. 

> Work Hard, Play Hard!

What is the end goal of your life? This is the question I'm asking myself everyday. My current answer is to experience, to learn and to understand this complicated world, as well as to make commitment. What is your answer?
